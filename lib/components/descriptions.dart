I love helping people, and I hope that I will be able to help you!";

const wyaDescription = "In November 2021, I participated in a hackathon where I began building a mobile app called Where You At? This app is marketed towards young single adults who want to connect with peers and find events to go to in their area. They can create their own one-time or recurring events, as well as find local events they are interested in participating in. I am utilizing Google APIs to embed Google Maps which indicate events using Google location services.";

const gameDescription = "Late night inspiration struck, and soon I will be building a mobile game app called \"Don\'t Get Me Started\", where you and your friends or family put your improvisation skills to the test! You have 30 seconds to rant about a randomly generated topic, with the other players as the judges.\n\nIf you run out of things to say before the time is up, no points for you! This game will be great for families or large groups of friends, and the randomness will keep you all laughing!";

const writeNowDescription = "As mentioned in the Education section, I developed a full-stack application in my Advanced Web Development class. I am continuing to develop and improve on it and it will soon be live for use.\n\n\"Write Now\" helps people who struggle with journaling. Every day, you are given a new, random prompt to respond to, removing the difficulty of not knowing what to write about. You can share your entries and prompts with loved ones to stay connected through each other\'s thoughts and feelings.";

const goatnotesDescription = "As mentioned in the Education section, I developed a full-stack application with a complex database structure in my Databases class. This project has been continuing for a while and many new features are being added. Currently, GOAT Notes is live for use!\n\nGOAT Notes removes the pain of useless note-taking by helping you organize your notes in a helpful way. No more need to waste time making physical flashcards or searching through pages of notes to make a Quizlet. Now, you can keep vocab words, study questions, helpful links, and notes all separated so that you can study effectively right then and there! Study plans keep you accountable, as well as the ability to automatically share note pages with friends for collaborative study.";

// Experience
const eurekaDescription = "I am currently working on a small team with the head of the IT & Cybersecurity department at BYU doing mobile application development. We are researching the effectiveness of the gamification of health data. The Eureka Trail uses real life steps that your phone tracks and syncs them to the game, making your progress on the trail dependent on your physical activity. I am a full stack developer on this project, integrating Google APIs with our front-end application.";

const sandboxDescription = "Beginning September 2022, I will be working as a software engineer alongside a product manager and designer to build and launch a technology startup company.

// Education
const byuDescription = "Brigham Young University has a fantastic Information Technology program. It is ranked #3 among the 2022 Best Colleges for Information Technology in America. It is also paired with Cybersecurity, so I am receiving in-depth training in both IT and Cybersecurity disciplines.\n\nI am focusing my education on software development so that my full-stack skills are optimal and high-level, making me a major benefit to companies and clients!";

const cppDescription = "Part of the curriculum at BYU for Information Technology is taking several courses in C++. I have learned how to perform object oriented programming, build complex data structures from scratch, implement several useful and common algorithms, and build a datalog program interpreter from scratch using discrete math.\n\nThese courses spanned 3 semesters and have been foundational in my programming skills. I have also gained useful skills in debugging and utilizing the IDE tools in Visual Studio and CLion.";

const webDevDescription = "One of my favorite BYU classes has been advanced web development, where I built a full-stack web application. This class teaches asynchronous and functional programming, deployment and database connections, and advanced concepts in web frameworks.\n\nMy application is marketed towards those who struggle to write in a journal for various reasons. It gives users a new prompt to respond to each day so that journaling doesn't need to take a long time and can be simple with unique entries.";

const databaseDescription = "In my databases class, I learned how to build and implement complex relational databases, as well as NoSQL databases. I worked with a small group to develop a relational database and implement it into a full-stack web application.\n\nOur project was to create an online note-taking system that beats all others. It is designed for effectiveness and will help users to organize their notes in a way that will promote better learning and efficiency.";

const cloudDescription = "One of my IT electives was a course about cloud architecture and security on Amazon Web Services. Through this class, I was enrolled in the AWS Academy foundations and architecting courses.\n\nI learned how to use the many tools AWS offers, and at the end of the semester I presented a capstone project of something I built on AWS.";
